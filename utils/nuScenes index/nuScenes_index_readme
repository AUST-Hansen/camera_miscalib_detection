nuScenes has much more data than KITTI
We are using a subsampled version (40-80 images per scene)
There are 1100 scenes, done on 3 cars: 2 in Boston(car_b1,car_b2) and one in Singapore(car_s1), each has 1 set of calibration parameters PER CAMERA. Camera car_b2 has only 15 sequences so has not been labeled train,test, or valid. The rest have.

Each car has 6 cameras:

CAM_FRONT
CAM_FRONT_RIGHT
CAM_BACK_RIGHT
CAM_BACK
CAM_BACK_LEFT
CAM_FRONT_LEFT

IMPORTANT:CAM_BACK should not be used as it contains part of the car!

We have train, valid, and test tags for both car_b1 and car_s1. Only the scenes recorded during the day are used. Number of sequences in each split:

for car_b1:
Train: 300
Valid: 100
Test: 52

for car_s1:
Train: 200
Valid: 50
Test: 34

Example tags for training:
CAM_FRONT+car_b1+train
CAM_FRONT+car_b1+valid
CAM_FRONT+car_b1+test
CAM_FRONT+car_s1+train
CAM_FRONT+car_s1+valid
CAM_FRONT+car_s1+test
